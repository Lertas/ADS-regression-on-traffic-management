Project for Msc in Data Science project for the subject of the Applied Data Science. Study of perfomance and scalability of various regression methods on traffic management.

We use a dataset with airlines in USA and we predict the departure delay. 
From the results that we take we compare them with respect to scalability and perfomance.
Then, we write a paper with the final results and conclusions.
For comparing we use some statistical methods as Friedman test for repeated measurements, Kruskal-Wallis H-test test, Analysis of variance (ANOVA), 
all these to compare more than 2 algorithms.
For comparing 2 algorithms, we use Mann-Whitney U Test, Cohen's d, Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Independent two-sample t-test and boxplots.
Also, we compare them with respect to R2 and RMSE.
