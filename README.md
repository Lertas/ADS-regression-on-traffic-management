Project for Msc in Data Science project for the subject of the Applied Data Science. Study of perfomance and scalability of various regression methods on traffic management.

We use a dataset with airlines in USA and we predict the departure delay. 
From the results that we take we compare them with respect to scalability and perfomrnce.
Then, we wrote a paper with the final results and conclusions.
